    "Интернет-магазин «Викишоп» запускает новый сервис. Теперь пользователи могут редактировать и дополнять описания товаров, как в вики-сообществах. То есть клиенты предлагают свои правки и комментируют изменения других. Магазину нужен инструмент, который будет искать токсичные комментарии и отправлять их на модерацию. \n",
    "Обучите модель классифицировать комментарии на позитивные и негативные. В вашем распоряжении набор данных с разметкой о токсичности правок.\n",
    "Постройте модель со значением метрики качества F1 не меньше 0.75. "
